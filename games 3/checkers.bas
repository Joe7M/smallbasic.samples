' Checkers program

' Written by KC Goldberg and Sons, November, 2004
' Written in SmallBASIC for Windows, 0.9.5.2

' This program was written as a teaching example with me and my sons
' We used SmallBASIC mostly because it is cool and free. For this particular
' application, the array structure (including nested arrays) and the ability
' of functions to return an array make this almost LISP-like, which is perfect
' for turn-based games and the MiniMax algorithm

' In addition to the rich array strucure, there is a simple mechanism to
' capture both console input and mouse clicks, and a very accessible
' graphics package.

' Finally, although I have not done this, the ability to port this to my
' PalmPilot is just too cool!

' The program here will either ask the user to make a move using a
' "click on the board" interface, or generate one itself using the
' MiniMax algorithm.

' To add different board evaluators, look into function EvaluateBoard
' and Function DetermineMove for different ply depths

' =====================================================================
' Data types:
' Board: Array Squares x Squares of pieces
' B(1,1) = lower left
' B(Squares,Squares) = upper right
' Piece: Integer; -2,2: King; -1,1 Piece; 0 Blank
' Move: Array of 4x1 listing coordinates (from, to) e.g. [x1,y1,x2,y2]
' MoveList: An array containing moves e.g. [[x1,y1,x2,y2],[x2,y2,x3,y3], ...]
' To move a piece, a move exists for each intermediate step as well; a jump
' will imply three elements - initial, the square of the piece being jumped,
' and the termination; a double jump will have five elements, etc.
' MoveListArray: An array of MoveLists
' MiniMaxResult: [Score, Move] where score is a numeric board evaluation Score

' ===========================================================================
' Procedures:

' DisplayBoard (Board) : Display a board

' Functions:

' MakeMove (Board, MoveList) = Board : Apply a MoveList to a Board
' GenerateMoveList (Board, Side) = MoveListArray : Generate list of all valid moves for Side
' GetUserMove (Board, Side) = MoveList : Ask user to move for Side
' InitBoard = Board : Return a new board with pieces in initial position
' Func MiniMax(Board, Side, Depth, DepthMax, Evaluator) = MiniMaxResult
' : Perform MiniMax algorithm search to find best move for Side (see declaration
' for description of all parameters)
' EvaluateBoard (Board, Side, Evaluator) = Score : Return a numeric score with positive
' numbers favoring Side using the evaluation function specified by Evaluator
' This should only be called from within MiniMax; technically I should probably make
' it a private function of Minimax, but as it too has private functions, that seemed
' like a lot of overhead for Minimax, which will be called recursively
' DetermineMove (Board, Side) = MoveList : Use the method stored in PlayerStrategy(Side)
' to determine the next move for Side to make
' Main : Main procedure loop
'

' Constants
' Size of the board (default = 8 for standard checkers)

' Number of rows to fill in at start (default = 3 for standard checkers)

Const Piece = 1
Const King = 2
Const Blank = 0

' This defines the sides
